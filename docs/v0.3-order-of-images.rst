Order Of Images
===============

All information here is only for files that has multiply images and when first image in file is not a `PrimaryImage`

Versions <0.3.0
***************

Old behaviour was that the primary image was always first, no matter in which position it was in file.
And during saving, first image was always primary.
You can take a look at these two files:

This is the original `nokia:alpha.heic <https://github.com/bigcat88/pillow_heif/blob/master/tests/images/etc_heif/nokia/alpha.heic>`_

This file was created from it with thumbnails added:
`nokia:alpha_with_thumbs.heic <https://https://github.com/bigcat88/pillow_heif/blob/master/tests/images/etc_heif/nokia/alpha_3_2.heic>`_

As you can see, third image that is `primary` in that container switched from pos 3, to pos 1 after saving.
Not a big deal, but it can be considered as a small little bug in some cases.

Here is the code from versions till `0.3.0`:

.. code-block:: python

    main_image_id = heif_ctx.get_main_img_id()
    top_img_ids = heif_ctx.get_top_images_ids()
    top_img_list = [main_image_id] + [i for i in top_img_ids if i != main_image_id]

Reworked image order handling
*****************************

Reading
"""""""

Easiest way to handle this for usage **not** as a Pillow plugin is to change :py:class:`~pillow_heif.HeifFile`
that it will point as in old versions to `primary` image, but not to place that image as first in `top_img_list`.

So this code will be equal in both old and new versions:

.. code-block:: python

    heif_file = open_heif("input.hec")
    print(heif_file.mode, heif_file.size)

And this will have different behaviour:

.. code-block:: python

    heif_file = open_heif("input.hec")
    print(heif_file[0].mode, heif_file[0].size)

For Pillow plugin this will be a bit break change when you use it to work with image containers,
cause from this change if you need to find a primary image you need to iterate throw all images and find image with
``info["primary"]=True``.

Writing
"""""""

In `0.2.x` versions when encoder was introduced, there was no way to create a file with primary image that is not in a first place.

From now, first image will be `primary`, unless after first image there is no images with `info["primary"]` set to ``True``.
So, last image with `info["primary"]` == ``True`` will be the primary image.

In most cases you do not need to bother yourself with this, as other image formats are much simpler and has no such abilities
and when converting to `HEIF` it will just worked as before.

Converting from `HEIF` to `HEIF` will work as before, no any changes for both `HeifFile` or `Pillow plugin` usage part,
it will just place primary image position as it was in original image and do it right.

When you need to change `primary` image for some reason, just set `info["primary"]` of image to ``True``
and all images after that should not have `info["primary"]` == ``True``.

Method ``save`` supports ``primary_index`` parameter, that accepts index of image or ``-1`` to set last image as `PrimaryImage`.

Specifying ``primary_index`` during ``save`` has highest priority.

That's all.
